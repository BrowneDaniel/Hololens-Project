This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.

This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL


-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.

This software uses PlayReady technology to access PlayReady-protected content and/or WMDRM-protected content.  Microsoft may decide to revoke the software‚Äôs ability to consume PlayReady-protected content for reasons including but not limited to (i) if a breach or potential breach of PlayReady technology occurs, (ii) proactive robustness enhancement, and (iii) if Content owners require the revocation because the software fails to properly enforce restrictions on content usage.  Revocation should not affect unprotected content or content protected by other content access technologies.  Content owners may require you to upgrade PlayReady to access their content.  If you decline an upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade and may not be able to install other operating system updates or upgrades.  
x.	Package Managers. The software may include package managers, like NuGet, that give you the option to download other Microsoft and third party software packages to use with your application. Those packages are under their own licenses, and not this agreement. Microsoft does not distribute, license or provide any warranties for any of the third party packages.
xi.	Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You may only embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to help print content.

THIS PRODUCT IS LICENSED UNDER THE AVC AND THE VC-1 PATENT PORTFOLIO LICENSES FOR THE PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE OF A CONSUMER TO (i) ENCODE VIDEO IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ABOVE STANDARDS (‚ÄúVIDEO STANDARDS‚Äù) AND/OR (ii) DECODE AVC, AND VC-1 VIDEO THAT WAS ENCODED BY A CONSUMER ENGAGED IN A PERSONAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY AND/OR WAS OBTAINED FROM A VIDEO PROVIDER LICENSED TO PROVIDE SUCH VIDEO. NONE OF THE LICENSES EXTEND TO ANY OTHER PRODUCT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH PRODUCT IS INCLUDED WITH THIS SOFTWARE IN A SINGLE ARTICLE. NO LICENSE IS GRANTED OR SHALL BE IMPLIED FOR ANY OTHER USE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY BE OBTAINED FROM MPEG LA, L.L.C. SEE WWW.MPEGLA.COM.
For clarification purposes, this notice does not limit or inhibit the use of the software for normal business uses that are personal to that business which do not include (i) redistribution of the software to third parties, or (ii) creation of content with the VIDEO STANDARDS compliant technologies for distribution to third parties.
3.	INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time. 
a.	Consent for Internet-Based Services. The software features described below and in the privacy statement at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839 connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. In some cases, you may switch off these features or not use them. By using these features, you consent to the transmission of this information. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.
i.	Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser, and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.
‚Ä¢	Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP). This software uses CEIP. CEIP automatically sends Microsoft information about your hardware and how you use the software. We do not use this information to identify or contact you. CEIP will also periodically download a small file to your computer. This file helps us collect information about problems that you have while using the software. When available, new help information about the errors might also be automatically downloaded. To learn more about CEIP and how to turn it off, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=525878. 
‚Ä¢	Digital Certificates. The software uses digital certificates. These digital certificates confirm the identity of Internet users sending X.509 standard encryption information. They also can be used to digitally sign files and macros to verify the integrity and origin of the file contents. The software retrieves certificates and updates certificate revocation lists using the Internet, when available.
‚Ä¢	Error Reports. This software automatically sends error reports to Microsoft. These reports include information about problems that occur in the software. Sometimes reports contain information about other programs that interact with the software. Reports might unintentionally contain personal information. For example, a report that contains a snapshot of computer memory might include your name. Part of a document you were working on could be included as well. Microsoft does not use this information to identify or contact you. To learn more about error reports, see http://oca.microsoft.com/en/dcp20.asp. 
‚Ä¢	Windows Application Certification Kit. To ensure you have the latest certification tests, when launched this software periodically checks a Windows Application Certification Kit file on download.microsft.com to see if an update is available.¬† If an update is found, you are prompted and provided a link to a web site where you can download the update. You may use the Windows Application Certification Kit solely to test your programs before you submit them for a potential Microsoft Windows Certification and for inclusion on the Microsoft Windows Store. The results you receive are for informational purposes only. Microsoft has no obligation to either (i) provide you with a Windows Certification for your programs and/or ii) include your program in the Microsoft Windows Store.  
‚Ä¢	Microsoft Digital Rights Management for Silverlight. 
If you use Silverlight to access content that has been protected with Microsoft Digital Rights Management (DRM), in order to let you play the content, the software may automatically
‚Ä¢	request media usage rights from a rights server on the Internet and
‚Ä¢	download and install available DRM Updates.
For more information about this feature, including instructions for turning the Automatic Updates off, go to http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=147032.
‚Ä¢	Web Content Features.  Features in the software can retrieve related content from Microsoft and provide it to you.
